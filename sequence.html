    <h2>Sequence Formulas</h2>

    <h3>1. Arithmetic Sequence</h3>
    <p>An arithmetic sequence is a sequence in which each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference, \(d\), to the previous term.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>General Form: \(a_n = a_1 + (n - 1) \cdot d\)</li>
        <li>Sum of the First \(n\) Terms: \(S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot [2a_1 + (n - 1) \cdot d]\)</li>
        <li>Alternative Sum Formula: \(S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)\)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Geometric Sequence</h3>
    <p>A geometric sequence is a sequence in which each term after the first is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio, \(r\).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>General Form: \(a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}\)</li>
        <li>Sum of the First \(n\) Terms: \(S_n = a_1 \cdot \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}\) (for \(r \neq 1\))</li>
        <li>Sum to Infinity (for \(|r| < 1\)): \(S_\infty = \frac{a_1}{1 - r}\)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Harmonic Sequence</h3>
    <p>A harmonic sequence is a sequence of numbers where the reciprocal of the terms forms an arithmetic sequence.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>General Form: \(a_n = \frac{1}{a_1 + (n - 1) \cdot d}\)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Fibonacci Sequence</h3>
    <p>A Fibonacci sequence is a sequence where each term is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>General Form: \(F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}\), where \(F_1 = 0\) and \(F_2 = 1\)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Quadratic Sequence</h3>
    <p>A quadratic sequence is a sequence where the second differences between consecutive terms are constant.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>General Form: \(a_n = an^2 + bn + c\)</li>
    </ul>
