    <h3>1. Area of a Rectangle</h3>
    <p>The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width.</p>
    <p><strong>Formula:</strong> \( \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \)</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a rectangle has a length of 5 meters and a width of 3 meters, its area is \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) square meters.</p>

    <h3>2. Area of a Square</h3>
    <p>The area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of one of its sides.</p>
    <p><strong>Formula:</strong> \( \text{Area} = \text{Side}^2 \)</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a square has a side length of 4 meters, its area is \( 4^2 = 16 \) square meters.</p>

    <h3>3. Area of a Triangle</h3>
    <p>The area of a triangle is calculated by multiplying the base by the height and then dividing by 2.</p>
    <p><strong>Formula:</strong> \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height} \)</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a triangle has a base of 6 meters and a height of 4 meters, its area is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 4 = 12 \) square meters.</p>

    <h3>4. Area of a Parallelogram</h3>
    <p>The area of a parallelogram is calculated by multiplying its base by its height.</p>
    <p><strong>Formula:</strong> \( \text{Area} = \text{Base} \times \text{Height} \)</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a parallelogram has a base of 8 meters and a height of 5 meters, its area is \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \) square meters.</p>

    <h3>5. Area of a Trapezium</h3>
    <p>The area of a trapezium is calculated by taking the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides and then multiplying by the height.</p>
    <p><strong>Formula:</strong> \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Base}_1 + \text{Base}_2) \times \text{Height} \)</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a trapezium has bases of 7 meters and 5 meters, and a height of 3 meters, its area is \( \frac{1}{2} \times (7 + 5) \times 3 = 18 \) square meters.</p>

    <h3>6. Area of a Circle</h3>
    <p>The area of a circle is calculated by multiplying pi by the square of the radius.</p>
    <p><strong>Formula:</strong> \( \text{Area} = \pi \times \text{Radius}^2 \)</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a circle has a radius of 3 meters, its area is \( \pi \times 3^2 = 28.27 \) square meters (using \( \pi \approx 3.14 \)).</p>

    <h3>7. Circumference of a Circle</h3>
    <p>The circumference of a circle is calculated by multiplying 2 times pi by the radius.</p>
    <p><strong>Formula:</strong> \( \text{Circumference} = 2 \times \pi \times \text{Radius} \)</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a circle has a radius of 4 meters, its circumference is \( 2 \times \pi \times 4 = 25.13 \) meters (using \( \pi \approx 3.14 \)).</p>

    <h3>8. Perimeter of a Rectangle</h3>
    <p>The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding together twice the length and twice the width.</p>
    <p><strong>Formula:</strong> \( \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \)</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a rectangle has a length of 5 meters and a width of 3 meters, its perimeter is \( 2 \times (5 + 3) = 16 \) meters.</p>

    <h3>9. Perimeter of a Square</h3>
    <p>The perimeter of a square is calculated by multiplying the length of one of its sides by 4.</p>
    <p><strong>Formula:</strong> \( \text{Perimeter} = 4 \times \text{Side} \)</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a square has a side length of 4 meters, its perimeter is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) meters.</p>
