        <h3>Basic Probability Formula</h3>
        <p>Probability of an event (A) happening:</p>
        <p><strong>P(A) = \(\frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}\)</strong></p>

    <!-- Complementary Probability -->
    <div class="formula">
        <h3>Complementary Probability</h3>
        <p>Probability of the event not happening (A'):</p>
        <p><strong>P(A') = 1 - P(A)</strong></p>

        <h3>Addition Rule of Probability</h3>
        <p>For any two events A and B, the probability that A or B occurs (or both):</p>
        <p><strong>P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)</strong></p>

    <!-- Multiplication Rule -->
    <div class="formula">
        <h3>Multiplication Rule of Probability</h3>
        <p>For independent events A and B, the probability that both A and B occur:</p>
        <p><strong>P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)</strong></
